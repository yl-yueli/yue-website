Hi! I'm Yue (I like to pronounce it yoo-ee). 

I grew up in Houston, TX after spending the first seven years of my life in Japan. I graduated Stanford in 2019 in Mathematical and Computational Science, and then got my Master's in Computational and Mathematical Engineering in 2020. 

I'm currently working at [OpenLattice](www.openlattice.com) as a Data Scientist, where I primarily work with local governments in disaster response and criminal justice reform. I'm a bit more partial to R (had an amazing class in R one year and ended up TA-ing the course & deep diving in R) but I also love working in Python and SQL.

In my free time, I like to pick up new art hobbies. I've recently gotten into weaving, watercolors, digital paintings, embroidery... Just to name a few.

At Stanford, I also made [podcasts](https://storytelling.stanford.edu/2019/12/09/materializing/) [like](https://storytelling.stanford.edu/2019/05/01/solitude/) [these](https://storytelling.stanford.edu/2018/04/27/speculation/)!
